# Separation-of-Cerebral-Hiperintense-Lesions

This project uses radiomics and machine learning to perform an automatic separation of multiplesclerosis (MS) and Cerebrovascular (CVL) lesions that cannot be 
easily separated by a naked-eye analysis, since they both appear as hyperintense spots in MRI-FLAIR images. This study will investigates the separation
in two experiments: only-FLAIR-Radiomic-Features and only-3DT1-Radiomic-Features   

Hereinside contains the image-dataset harmonization preprocessings as well as image preparation for radiomic features extraction;

Also, the Machine Learning experiment setup will be fully detailed here.
